Java application, made as an university project through the 3rd semester, focused on solidifying my understanding of design patterns, such as the layered architecture pattern or the Observer/Observable pattern.

Main functionalities:
  - requesting, accepting, declining and deleting friendships for the account the user is logged into
  - sending messages and replying to messages between two accounts, the chat being refreshed using the Observer/Observable pattern.

Technologies used:
  - Java (+ JavaFX for the frontend)
  - PostgreSQL database
