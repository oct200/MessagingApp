Java application, made as a university project throught the 3rd semestered, focused on solidifying my understanding of design patterns, such as the layered architecture pattern or the Observer/Observable pattern.

Main functionalities:
  - requesting, accepting, declining and deleting friendships for the account the user is logged into
  - sending messages and reply to messages between two accounts, the chat being refreshed through the usage of the Observer/Observable pattern.

Technologies used:
  - Java (+ JavaFX for the frontend)
  - PostgreSQL database
